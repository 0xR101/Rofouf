Our project proposes the development of an innovative web platform tailored to 
the unique needs of the Saudi Arabian market, aiming to transform the 
landscape of book acquisition and literary engagement. At its core, the platform 
will serve as a dynamic eCommerce hub, enabling users to sell, buy, exchange, 
or rent used books, thereby making literature more accessible, affordable, and 
sustainable for all, especially students and young readers. Complementing this, 
the platform will also cultivate a vibrant community of book lovers, offering 
spaces for reviews, discussions, book recommendations, and interactions akin 
to the functionalities found on Goodreads. This dual approach not only 
addresses the practical challenges of obtaining books in Saudi Arabia, such as 
high costs and limited availability of rare titles but also fosters a rich cultural 
exchange, enhancing the intellectual fabric of the community. Through this 
project, we aim to democratize access to literature and create a thriving 
ecosystem where books and ideas circulate freely among readers.
